[**Epitome**](http://www.epitome-ai.com) is the world's first experimental open platform dedicated to the deep integration of artificial intelligence and social sciences. Through seven major modules, the platform provides intelligent assistance across entire process，ranging from experimental intervention, experimental environment, to experimental participants, helping researchers easily design and conduct complex human-computer interaction experimental scenarios. This enables systematic research on AI's social impact and exploration of comprehensive solutions, advancing the harmonious integration of artificial intelligence into human society.

## Key Features

### **Controllable Experimental Advancement, Improving Research Quality**

**Scalable Experimental Scale**: Break through the venue and personnel limitations of traditional offline experiments, with digital platforms effectively expanding experimental scale and providing support for long-term tracking research and cross-cultural comparative experiments.

**Precise Process Control**: Preset interaction processes that balance the tension between experimental control and realistic simulation, achieving unity between high standardization and naturalness.

**Enhanced Reproducibility**: Standardized experimental processes based on AI and workflows significantly improve research reproducibility and verifiability, helping address the "reproducibility crisis" in social sciences.

## Ongoing Projects
### 1. Global Assessment of Cross-Cultural Interactive Alignment for Multimodal Large Model Safety Values
With the rapid development of AI technology and the continuous emergence of multimodal large models, we conduct global assessment of cross-cultural interactive alignment for multimodal large model safety values. Through large-scale testing, we compare the cross-cultural safety value adaptation capabilities of cutting-edge SOTA multimodal models across international populations, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of each model. This provides key data support and theoretical foundation for global cross-cultural application and optimization of multimodal models, helping promote safer, more precise, and more efficient service to users of different cultural backgrounds worldwide, and fostering adaptive development and ethical safety construction of AI technology globally.

### 2. Global Survey on Public Innovation Expectations and Risk Perceptions of Artificial Intelligence
At the 2025 French Artificial Intelligence Action Summit, 60 countries and international organizations signed a declaration emphasizing AI accessibility. Under different cultural contexts, global public expectations for AI innovation and risk perceptions vary significantly. Current AI governance systems rely on expert judgment and policy frameworks but lack public opinion as a foundational basis. This experiment aims to launch a global research program under the UN framework, with goals including cross-national surveys, constructing empirical foundations, identifying challenges in underdeveloped regions and proposing strategies, promoting inclusive and fair AI governance models, bridging the gap between expert assessments and public perceptions, and supporting responsible AI development and application.

### 3. Multimodal LLM-Assisted Educational Intervention Experiment for Correcting Antibiotic Misuse in Helicobacter Pylori Treatment Among Primary Care Physicians
This research focuses on the corrective impact of multimodal LLM-assisted education on antibiotic misuse behavior in Helicobacter pylori treatment among primary care physicians. In over 2,300 community service centers and township health centers in Jiangxi Province, as well as 27,000 village clinics, we introduce LLMs with PPT-based questioning and problem-solving capabilities, aiming to improve primary care physicians' Helicobacter pylori diagnosis and treatment skills, optimize antibiotic use, correct misuse behaviors, and thereby improve primary healthcare service quality and patient treatment outcomes.

### 4. Research on AI Model Persuasion Mechanisms, Efficacy, and Collaborative Enhancement
With rapid AI development, its persuasion potential in information dissemination and opinion shaping has become increasingly prominent, generating widespread attention. However, systematic understanding of its persuasion capabilities, especially its independent persuasion efficacy, influence mechanisms, and collaborative effects in assisting human persuasion, still lacks in-depth empirical exploration. This research aims to comprehensively evaluate AI's autonomous persuasion effects through a series of experiments and deeply explore its actual benefits and underlying mechanisms as an intelligent assistant in argument optimization and counterargument responses. The research outcomes will deepen theoretical understanding of AI's social impact and reveal AI persuasion's potential and ethical challenges. This not only provides key empirical evidence for optimizing human-AI collaboration and developing responsible AI applications but also offers scientific guidance for formulating relevant ethical norms and governance policies, ultimately promoting the construction of an efficient and trustworthy human-AI integrated society.

### 5. Intelligent Diagnostic System for Collaborative Problem-Solving Abilities
Collaborative problem-solving ability has been established by international organizations such as UNESCO as a "core skill for 21st-century life and work," primarily focusing on multi-person coordination to solve practical problems. In today's era of rapid AI development and widespread use of large models, traditional collaborative problem-solving ability assessment is facing upgrade opportunities. This experiment targets users of different age groups, conducting intelligent assessment of collaborative problem-solving abilities, aiming to explore more comprehensive and precise diagnostic models in the new era of human-AI collaboration.

### 6. Evolution of Chain of Thought: Experimental Research on Feedback Learning and Dynamic Optimization in Human-AI Collaboration
This experiment focuses on chain of thought, human feedback, human-AI collaboration, and evolution. In the experiment, humans provide feedback intervention on COT chain of thought, enhancing large models' dual memory capabilities, continuously aligning with human preferences, and meeting customized and personalized needs. Meanwhile, its strong memory capabilities avoid repeated mistakes, and evolutionary abilities can identify users' potential preferences for deep alignment, exploring optimization paths and collaborative efficiency improvement for large models in human-AI collaboration.
